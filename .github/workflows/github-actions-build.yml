      - 'v*.*.*' # Trigger on tags matching v<major>.<minor>.<patch> (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.3.4)
      # You can adjust this pattern. Examples:

    steps:
      # 1. Checkout code
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # Use fetch-depth: 0 if you need to access Git history (e.g., for changelogs)
        # fetch-depth: 0

      # 2. Set up Go environment

        with:

          # Optional: cache Go modules for faster builds
          cache: true

      # 3. Get the version from the tag
      # Extracts the tag name (e.g., "v1.0.0") and strips the leading 'v' for use in artifact names

          # -o my-app-binary: Output file name
          # ./cmd/git-reports: Path to your main Go package (adjust as needed)
