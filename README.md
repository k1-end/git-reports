## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
To generate reports for a Git repository, simply run:
```bash
./git-reports
```
By default, it will analyze the current directory.

### Specify Repository Path
To analyze a specific Git repository, use the `--path` flag:
```bash
./git-reports --path /path/to/your/git/repo
```

### Choose Output Format
You can choose between console (default) and HTML output using the `--printer` flag:
```bash
./git-reports --printer html
```

### Save Output to File
To save the report to a file, use the `--output` flag:
```bash
./git-reports --output report.html
```

### Filter by Developer
To analyze commits by a specific developer, use the `--dev` flag:
```bash
./git-reports --dev developer@example.com
```

### Filter by Date Range
To analyze commits within a specific date range, use the `--from` and `--to` flags (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`):
```bash
./git-reports --from 2023-01-01 --to 2023-12-31
```

### Combine Options
You can combine multiple options:
```bash
./git-reports --path /path/to/repo --dev developer@example.com --from 2023-01-01 --to 2023-12-31 --printer html --output report.html
```

### Check Version
To check the version of Git Reports:
```bash
./git-reports --version
```

### Use console printer with a pager (less)
In case you want to use the console printer with a pager, you can use the `less` command with -R option to allow ANSI colors:
```bash
./git-reports --printer console | less -R
```
